# WeatherApp - Started with Create Next.js 13, GraphQL, TailwindCSS, Tremore, Typescript and Stepzen

The weather application, developed using Next.js 13, GraphQL, TypeScript, Tremor, Stepzen, and Tailwind CSS, allows users to select a country and city to retrieve detailed weather information. It provides temperature, date, time, forecast, maximum and minimum temperature, UV index, wind speed, wind direction, chance of rain, and humidity levels. The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across different devices and screen sizes.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
